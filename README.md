__DriverPass Project Summary__
Working on Project DriverPass was about making a difference to the real people who benefit from it. Students, who just want to pass their driving test, and staff who require a hassle-free way of managing lessons and progression. Click an image below to learn how we’ve created a no nonsense, online solution for our student / clients that removes guess work and confusion, increasing everyone’s success. The idea behind DriverPass is to replace the burden and anxiety of inadequate methods with something practical and supportive. 

__What Went Well__
Getting the clients’ functional and non-functional requirements from the interview transcript was amazing and an eye-opener into what happens behind the scenes of every great application. Drawing the application diagrams (sequence, activities, use case and UML) was also something I did not take lightly. 
It’s gratifying to review and think about how early discussions with users influenced everything from interface design to features built for functionality, such as easy booking of lessons and real-time tracking. Those diagrams, those requirements. They’re not just hardcore pieces of paper; they’re how good ideas turn into useful solutions. 

__Room for Improvement__
If I could go back and change one thing, it would be spending more time elaborating on “what if” situations like what happens if the server goes down or you put in the wrong info. Tiny details like error messages or edge cases can catch users out. Fewer exceptions, more flow charts and examples might make the entire system work even more smoothly. 

__Understanding the User’s Needs__
It’s easy to say, but careful listening is the actual secret. By drilling down into what users find difficult and what they need to succeed, you can build features that truly address issues in ways like progress tracking and scheduling seamlessly. The result is a design that’s less about what can be done technically and more about what matters to the user. It’s that approach that makes all the difference, transforming a generic system into something supportive and empowering. 

__Approach to Future Design__
Moving forward, lots of open-ended conversations at the outset of every project and “what would make your day easier?” questions is key. Sketching, prototyping, diagramming what you are building early on helps to push the service generals and make way for honest feedback so that you can save yourself drastic pain later down the road. And whether that’s UML diagrams, use cases, or just rough wireframes, constant check-ins with users and stakeholders keep everyone paddling in the same direction. That’s how design blossoms from “just an idea” into a system that people would actually prefer using.
